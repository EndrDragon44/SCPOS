This space contains various files and tools that I've created as a collection of extras to complement my SCPos. These files aren't important to the installation of the OS.

Please note that any finalized, polished, and official releases are not directly included in this repository. Instead, you can find them as downloadable assets via the **[Releases](https://github.com/EndrDragon44/SCPOS/releases)** section. This is because GitHub only allows files under 2 Gigs.

Read the release nots, and in it will be a download link (or two) for Mediafire. I ALWAYS use Mediafire since its easy and friendly.
